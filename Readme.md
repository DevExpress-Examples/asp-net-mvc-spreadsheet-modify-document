This example demonstrates how to modify a document in the Spreadsheet extension.
The main idea of this approach is to perform a callback using the  [PerformCallback](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/js-ASPxClientSpreadsheet.PerformCallback%28parameter%29) method and modify a document in the  [CallbackRouteValues](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNet/DevExpress.Web.Mvc.SpreadsheetSettings.CallbackRouteValues) action.
